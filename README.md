# game_prototypes
Several projects related to game development, all in XNA/MonoGame.
All of them are either prototypes, or just testbeds for several things in the future.

Projects may or may not compile, or have precompiled versions. Absolutely no support will be given about compilation of said projects. Please view the codes for projects if you want to know more, as (if exists) their precompiled binaries might not reflect the true depth of project (e.g. sRPGBase).
